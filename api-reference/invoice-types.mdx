## What types of invoices can there be?
Invoices have two types: Regular and P2P. They are specified when [creating an invoice](/api-reference/endpoint/create-invoice) in the ``type`` field.
> So, what is the difference?

### Regular
This is a normal invoice that uses our service addresses. After payment, the money goes to our addresses, and you can request a withdrawal in your account.

### P2P
In this type you will be able to specify already your addresses for receiving cryptocurrency, after payment of your invoice. To do this, you must go to your personal merchant account and add the addresses of the networks you need.
After that you will be able to receive cryptocurrency from paid invoices directly to your address.

_When paying such an invoice, a commission of __1%__ of the invoice amount will be deducted from your Finup wallet._
Or if you have a user listed as `commission payer`, the commission will be charged to that user. You can specify `Commission Payer` when creating a merchant.

<Info>
Attention, when you create a _P2P invoice_, you will be able to pay only with those coins and networks for which you have added addresses.
</Info>

<Warning>
Also, if you use exchange wallets as _P2P_ addresses for receiving, you should take into account the minimum deposit and other exchange restrictions. Finup is not responsible for this.
