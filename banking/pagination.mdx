# How does pagination work?

Pagination is only available in some endpoints. First you pass the pagination settings to the body of the request.

> per_page - How many items will be on the page.
>
> page - Page to view.
>
> sort_by - Field to sort by.
>
> sort_direction - Sort direction (“asc”, “desc”).

#### Example:
```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "per_page": 5,
    "page": 1,
    "sort_by": "created_at",
    "sort_direction": "asc"
  }
}
```
In this example, we divide the data into pages of at most 5 elements and sort them by the `created_at` field in ascending order. If there are more than 5 elements, there will be several pages and we can switch them using page.

The page count starts at 1. The response will also return information about pagination and the data to which pagination was applied in the "result" key. Example:
```json
{
    "result": [
        {
            "id": "661000000000000000000",
            "account_id": "661000000000000000000",
            "source_id": "661000000000000000000",
            "source": "Wallet",
            "status": "Approved",
            "side": "Credit",
            "amount": 0.56,
            "currency": "EUR",
            "type": "Referral",
            "created_at": "2024-04-25T09:56:16.726Z",
            "updated_at": "2024-04-25T09:56:16.726Z",
            "source_identifier": "EUR00000001"
        },
        "... 4 more items"
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "current_page": 1,
        "total_records": 807,
        "total_pages": 162
    }
}
```

<Warning>
    If you specify a page that is greater than `total_pages` (Index out of range), the result will be empty.

    Also, if you don't pass the pagination object to the body, there will be no pagination information in the response
    either.
